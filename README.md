## Providing an overview of title conditions and helping all parties address potential issues.

### **Title Commitment**

---

### **Definition**  
A **title commitment** is a formal document issued by a title company that serves as a promise to provide a title insurance policy after meeting certain conditions. These conditions may include clearing outstanding liens, resolving title defects, or addressing any other issues that affect the property.

### **How It Relates to Title**  
- **Title Examination**: Before issuing a title commitment, a title examiner conducts a thorough review of public records to identify any problems with the property's title, such as liens, easements, or ownership disputes.  
- **Conditions and Exceptions**: The title commitment lists conditions (actions required to clear the title) and exceptions (issues that cannot be insured). These must be addressed before closing the transaction.  
- **Protection**: It ensures that the buyer and lender know the state of the title and what will or will not be covered by the title insurance policy.

### **Sections of a Title Commitment**  
1. **Schedule A**: Provides basic details, including the property description, the proposed insured parties (buyer and lender), and the insurance amount.  
2. **Schedule B-I**: Lists requirements that must be fulfilled for the title insurance to be issued (e.g., paying off liens or recording a new deed).  
3. **Schedule B-II**: Lists exceptions—items that the insurance will not cover, such as easements, CCRs, or zoning restrictions.

### **Example of a Title Commitment**  
- **Scenario**: A buyer is purchasing a home.  
  - The title company identifies an unpaid mortgage lien.  
  - The title commitment states the lien must be paid (Schedule B-I) before issuing title insurance.  
  - It also notes an existing utility easement (Schedule B-II), which will not affect the buyer's ownership but won’t be covered by insurance.

### **Why a Title Commitment Is Important**  
1. **Transparency**: Clearly outlines the state of the title before the sale is finalized.  
2. **Risk Management**: Helps the buyer and lender address any title issues before closing.  
3. **Legal Assurance**: Protects the parties involved by ensuring the title is insurable and marketable.

### **Conclusion**  
A title commitment is a crucial step in real estate transactions, providing an overview of title conditions and helping all parties address potential issues. It ensures that the buyer can acquire a property with a title that is clear and insurable.
